# Face-Emotion-Detection
This project is another example of how powerful CNN architecture can be. Training the model to recognize the certain set of emotion. This model is trained mainly on 7 set of emotions such as, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.

To get the data, kindly go to “https://www.kaggle.com/c/emotion-detection-from-facial-expressions/overview”

This was one of the Kaggle project and the winners of the competition obtained accuracy as given below.   

RBM (Yichuan Tang) — 71.162%

UNSUPERVISED (Yingbo Zhou & Chetan Ramaiah) — 69.267%

MAXIM MILAKOV (Maxim Milakov) — 68.821%

RADU+MARIUS+CRISTI (Radu Ionescu & Marius Popescu & Cristian Grozea) — 67.484%

My model managed to obtain a validation accuracy of approximately 67.69%, which is quite good given the fact that our target class has 7 possible values.

Thank you.
